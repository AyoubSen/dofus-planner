# What is this?

I made this cause of 2 reasons:

- Track Archimonsters I'm getting, and which ones I'm actually saving up for the Ocre quest, and which ones I can or want to sell.
- I also wanted to know which items to craft and focus on, but as someone who doesn't nolife the game, I don't really know the meta, so I've made something that would help me know which items are used the most, both in PVM and PVP.

# What's next?

- Whatever the fuck I want ?

---

On a serious note, I'll be mostly focusing on polishing the app for now, Plan goes as follows:

- [ ] Better Icons
- [x] Clearer Images for Classes
- [x] Better design for some areas (TBD)
- [x] Better filters flow/design
- [ ] More filters (TBD)
- [ ] Whatever I feel like is missing on the way (aka, TBD)
- [ ] different themes for the app

## Archimonstres:

- [ ] Import / Export data

#### Ocre Mode:

- [ ] Completion %
- [ ] Show monsters left in total
- [ ] Show how many and what monsters are left in each step

#### Sell Mode:

- [x] Track the ones captured to have an idea about which ones i tend to capture more of per X time
- [x] Visualize price trends for each monster over time
- [x] Highlight monsters that havenâ€™t sold for a long time
- [ ] Top Zones for Profit
- [ ] Show a list of monsters that are the "same" but have different price
- [ ] Add a search for the prices, cause im done with CTRL + F which doesnt even fucking work

## Items

-[x] Fix Classes icons
