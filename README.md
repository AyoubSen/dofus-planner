# What is this?

I made this cause of 2 reasons:

- Track Archimonsters I'm getting, and which ones I'm actually saving up for the Ochre quest, and which ones I can or want to sell.
- I also wanted to know which items to craft and focus on, but as someone who doesn't nolife the game, I don't really know the meta, so I've made something that would help me know which items are used the most, both in PVM and PVP.

# What's next?

- Whatever the fuck I want ?

---

On a serious note, I'll be mostly focusing on polishing the app for now, Plan goes as follows:

- [ ] Better Icons
- [ ] Clearer Images for Classes
- [ ] Better design for some areas (TBD)
- [ ] More filters (TBD)
- [ ] Whatever I feel like is missing on the way (aka, TBD)
